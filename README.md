This was for a grad school project for a course at Georgia Tech, Introduction to Modeling and Simulation, as part of the Professional Masters in Systems Engineering program. We only had a couple weeks to spin up this model so it is a little rough around the edges. But ultimately we modeled what we wanted.

The objective was to determine the minimum number of drones (used MK27 specs) required to achieve a 95% on-time delivery rate within a 7.5 nautical mile radius of the Baltimore Amazon Fulfillment Center. Census data was used to generate sample customers based on population density.
